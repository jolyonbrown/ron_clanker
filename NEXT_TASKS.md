### 2. **Price Change Prediction** üìà
**Priority: HIGH** (promoted from #3)
**Why**: Currently monitors but doesn't predict - can improve transfer decisions

Tasks:
- [ ] Implement price predictor model (models/price_change.py is empty)
- [ ] Collect historical price change data
- [ ] Track net transfers as predictor feature
- [ ] Build simple ML model (logistic regression ‚Üí gradient boosting)
- [ ] Test prediction accuracy (target: 70%+ accuracy)
- [ ] Integrate with Hugo for pre-emptive transfers

**Deliverable**: Predict price rises/falls 6-12 hours ahead

---

### 3. **Player Performance Prediction** üé≤
**Priority: HIGH** (promoted from #4)
**Why**: Currently uses form, but ML would be better for expected points

Tasks:
- [ ] Implement xG-based prediction model
- [ ] Historical data collection (GW1-7 for training)
- [ ] Feature engineering (form, fixtures, DC, xG, opponent strength)
- [ ] Train model for each position (GK, DEF, MID, FWD)
- [ ] Compare predicted vs actual points
- [ ] Integrate with value analyst rankings

**Deliverable**: More accurate expected points predictions

---

### 4. **Multi-Gameweek Planning** üìÖ
**Priority: MEDIUM** (promoted from #5)
**Why**: Currently reactive, needs to plan ahead

Tasks:
- [ ] Fixture difficulty prediction (3-6 gameweeks ahead)
- [ ] Transfer planning sequence (e.g., "GW10: out Palmer, in Saka, GW11: out Haaland, in Kane")
- [ ] Chip timing optimization (when to use Wildcard, Bench Boost, etc.)
- [ ] Template deviation analysis (when to follow/fade popular picks)
- [ ] Budget planning (build team value over season)

**Deliverable**: Ron plans 4-6 gameweeks ahead

---

### 6. **Learning and Improvement System** üìä
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Why**: System should improve from mistakes

Tasks:
- [ ] Track all decisions made (transfers, captain, chips)
- [ ] Compare predicted vs actual outcomes
- [ ] Identify systematic biases (e.g., "always underestimate defenders")
- [ ] Agent performance tracking (which analysts are most accurate?)
- [ ] Adjust weights based on historical accuracy
- [ ] Weekly review reports

**Deliverable**: System learns from experience and improves

---

### 7. **Monitoring Dashboard** üì±
**Priority: LOW**
**Why**: Nice to have for tracking Ron's decisions

Tasks:
- [ ] Simple web dashboard (Flask/FastAPI)
- [ ] Show current team selection
- [ ] Show recent decisions and reasoning
- [ ] Show cached YouTube transcripts
- [ ] Show intelligence gathered today
- [ ] Show agent performance metrics
- [ ] Historical points tracking

**Deliverable**: Web UI to monitor Ron's decisions

---

### 8. **FPL API Team Submission** üéØ
**Priority: MEDIUM** (moved from #2 - requires manual team registration first)
**Why**: Currently makes decisions but doesn't submit them to FPL

**BLOCKED**: Need to manually register Ron's FPL team first before implementing API submission

Tasks:
- [ ] Manual team registration (user to complete)
- [ ] Research FPL API authentication (session cookies, login)
- [ ] Implement team submission endpoint integration
- [ ] Add transfer execution (buy/sell players)
- [ ] Add captain selection submission
- [ ] Add chip activation submission
- [ ] Add safety checks (confirm before submission)
- [ ] Add dry-run mode for testing

**Note**: FPL API is unofficial, may need reverse engineering from browser network traffic

**Deliverable**: Ron can actually manage a live FPL team

---

### 9. **Chip Strategy Optimization** üÉè
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Why**: Chips worth 20-30 points if used correctly

Tasks:
- [ ] Wildcard timing (identify when team needs major overhaul)
- [ ] Bench Boost timing (identify gameweeks with strong bench)
- [ ] Triple Captain timing (identify high ceiling games)
- [ ] Free Hit timing (blank/double gameweeks)
- [ ] AFCON strategy (5 free transfers exploit)

**Deliverable**: Optimal chip usage timing

---

## LONG TERM (Future Sessions)

### 10. **Advanced ML Models** ü§ñ
**Priority: LOW**
**Why**: Phase 3-5 from CLAUDE.md

Tasks:
- [ ] Ensemble models (combine multiple prediction methods)
- [ ] Reinforcement learning for long-term planning
- [ ] Neural network for complex patterns
- [ ] Transfer learning from previous seasons
- [ ] Meta-learning (learn how to learn)

**Deliverable**: State-of-the-art FPL AI

---

### 11. **Risk Management** üé∞
**Priority: LOW**
**Why**: Strategy should depend on current rank

Tasks:
- [ ] Identify rank-based strategy (aggressive if behind, conservative if ahead)
- [ ] Calculate risk/reward of differentials
- [ ] Ownership-adjusted decisions (fade template when ahead)
- [ ] Variance management (high variance picks when chasing)

**Deliverable**: Adaptive strategy based on rank

---

### 12. **Integration Improvements** üîß
**Priority: LOW**
**Why**: Quality of life improvements

Tasks:
- [ ] Better error handling and recovery
- [ ] Logging improvements (structured logging)
- [ ] Better testing coverage
- [ ] Docker deployment optimization
- [ ] Database backups automation (‚úÖ partially complete)
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting (‚úÖ health checks complete)

**Deliverable**: More robust, production-ready system
