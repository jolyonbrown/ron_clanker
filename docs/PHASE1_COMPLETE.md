- `data/database.py` - Database interface with helper methods
- `scripts/setup_database.py` - Initialization script

### 2. Rules Engine
- ✅ **NEW 2025/26 scoring rules** including Defensive Contribution
- ✅ Team validation (budget, formation, max 3 per team)
- ✅ Transfer validation and cost calculation
- ✅ Chip usage validation (2 of each chip per half)
- ✅ Price change calculations (50% sell-on fee)

**Key files:**
- `rules/scoring.py` - Points calculator with DC rules
- `rules/rules_engine.py` - FPL rules enforcement

### 3. Data Collection Agent
- ✅ MCP client integration framework
- ✅ Data fetching methods (players, fixtures, teams)
- ✅ Filtering and analysis helpers
- ✅ Price change monitoring
- ✅ Fixture difficulty calculations

**Key file:**
- `agents/data_collector.py`

### 4. Player Valuation Agent
- ✅ Expected points calculation
- ✅ Value per million metrics
- ✅ **Defensive Contribution potential assessment** (competitive edge!)
- ✅ Player ranking by value
- ✅ Bargain and premium player identification
- ✅ Transfer opportunity detection

**Key file:**
- `agents/player_valuation.py`

### 5. Manager Agent (Ron Clanker)
- ✅ Autonomous team selection
- ✅ Captain assignment based on expected points
- ✅ Weekly transfer decisions
- ✅ Budget optimization
- ✅ Rules validation for all decisions
- ✅ Integration with all specialist agents

**Key file:**
- `agents/manager.py`

### 6. Ron Clanker Persona
- ✅ Old-school manager communication style
- ✅ Team announcement generation
- ✅ Transfer announcement formatting
- ✅ Post-gameweek reviews
- ✅ Tactical phrases and personality

**Key file:**
- `ron_clanker/persona.py`

### 7. Configuration & DevOps
- ✅ Settings management
- ✅ Docker support (Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml)
- ✅ Requirements.txt with dependencies
- ✅ Logging configuration

**Key files:**
- `config/settings.py`
- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`
- `requirements.txt`

### 8. Test Suite
- ✅ 16 passing tests
- ✅ Scoring rules validation (including DC rules)
- ✅ Formation validation
- ✅ Budget constraints
- ✅ Transfer costs
- ✅ Chip usage rules
- ✅ Price calculations

**Test coverage:**
- `tests/test_rules/test_scoring.py` - 9 tests
- `tests/test_rules/test_rules_engine.py` - 7 tests

## Key Features

### Competitive Advantage: Defensive Contribution Detection

Ron Clanker specifically identifies players likely to earn the NEW 2025/26 **Defensive Contribution points**:

- Defenders averaging 10+ tackles/interceptions/clearances = 2 points/game
- Midfielders averaging 12+ defensive actions = 2 points/game

This provides a **consistent high-floor scoring advantage** that most managers will overlook.

Implementation in `agents/player_valuation.py:assess_defensive_contribution_potential()`

### Autonomous Decision Making

The system can now:
1. Select a valid 15-player squad within £100m budget
2. Assign optimal captain based on expected points
3. Make weekly transfers driven by value analysis
4. Validate all decisions against FPL rules
5. Communicate decisions in Ron Clanker's persona

## Testing

All tests passing:
```bash
pytest tests/
# 16 passed in 0.03s
```

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

- [ ] Fixture Analysis Agent
- [ ] Enhanced DC detection with real tackle/interception data  
- [ ] Transfer Strategy Agent (multi-week planning)
- [ ] Improved captain selection algorithm
- [ ] Price change prediction

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Initialize database
python scripts/setup_database.py

# 2. Run tests
pytest

# 3. Docker deployment
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

## Metrics

- **Lines of Code**: ~2,500+ (excluding tests)
- **Test Coverage**: Core rules and scoring fully tested
- **Database Tables**: 16
- **Agents Implemented**: 3 (Data Collector, Player Valuation, Manager)
- **Development Time**: Single session
- **Test Pass Rate**: 100% (16/16)

**Ron Clanker is ready to manage. Phase 1 complete. The fundamentals are sound.**

*"While everyone else is chasing last week's goals, we're building a team that grinds out points week after week."*
