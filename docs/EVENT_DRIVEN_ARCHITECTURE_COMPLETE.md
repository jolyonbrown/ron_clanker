# Event-Driven Architecture - COMPLETE! 🎉

**Date Completed**: October 23, 2025
**Issue**: ron_clanker-81
**Branch**: feature/event-driven-manager
**Commits**: 7 phases

---

## Mission Accomplished

The Ron Clanker FPL system has been successfully migrated to a **fully event-driven architecture**. The legacy synchronous manager has been deprecated and replaced with a modern, scalable event-based system.

---

## What Was Built

### RonManager (agents/manager_agent_v2.py)

The new event-driven manager with 7 completed phases:

#### Phase 1: ML Dependencies ✅
- Added `DecisionSynthesisEngine` for ML predictions
- Added `TransferOptimizer` for multi-GW transfer planning
- Added `ChipStrategyAnalyzer` for optimal chip timing
- Graceful fallback if ML unavailable

#### Phase 2: Transfer Logic ✅
- `decide_transfers()` using TransferOptimizer
- Better than legacy manager (which doesn't use it!)
- Multi-gameweek value calculation
- Fallback to basic form-based logic

#### Phase 3: Captain Selection ✅
- ML-powered captain selection with expected points
- Differential vice-captain option
- Fallback to value_score sorting
- Handles edge cases gracefully

#### Phase 4: Chip Strategy ✅
- `decide_chip_usage()` using ChipStrategyAnalyzer
- Actually uses chip analysis (legacy doesn't!)
- Conservative 70% confidence threshold
- Proper chip timing evaluation

#### Phase 5: Weekly Decision Orchestration ✅
- `make_weekly_decision()` - THE MASTER METHOD
- 10-step autonomous pipeline:
  1. Load current team
  2. Decide transfers
  3. Execute transfers
  4. Assign positions (formation optimizer)
  5. Select captain
  6. Decide chip usage
  7. Generate announcement
  8. Save to draft_team
  9. Log all decisions
  10. Publish TEAM_SELECTED event

#### Phase 6: Production Script Update ✅
- Updated `pre_deadline_selection.py` to use RonManager
- Event bus initialization
- Proper async handling
- Clean shutdown

#### Phase 7: Deprecation ✅
- Renamed manager.py → manager_legacy.py
- Added comprehensive deprecation notice
- Updated all imports
- Package version bumped to 0.2.0

## Architecture Comparison

### Before (Synchronous)
```python
from agents.manager import ManagerAgent

ron = ManagerAgent(database=db)
transfers, chip, announcement = await ron.make_weekly_decision(gw)
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Blocking/synchronous
- ❌ No event publishing
- ❌ No downstream agent coordination
- ❌ Imports TransferOptimizer but doesn't use it
- ❌ Imports ChipStrategyAnalyzer but doesn't use it properly
- ❌ No current/draft team separation

### After (Event-Driven)
```python
from agents import RonManager

event_bus = get_event_bus()
await event_bus.start()

ron = RonManager(database=db)
await ron.start()

result = await ron.make_weekly_decision(gw)
# Publishes TEAM_SELECTED event
# Other agents can react automatically
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Non-blocking async architecture
- ✅ Publishes events for downstream agents
- ✅ Actually uses TransferOptimizer!
- ✅ Actually uses ChipStrategyAnalyzer!
- ✅ ML-powered decisions throughout
- ✅ Current/draft team separation
- ✅ Better logging and debugging
- ✅ Scalable for future features

## Event Flow

```
DAILY MONITORING (03:00):
  → Scout gathers intelligence (RSS, YouTube, websites)
  → Scout publishes INJURY_INTELLIGENCE, ROTATION_RISK
  → Hugo (TransferStrategy) caches intelligence alerts

PRE-DEADLINE (48h):
  → Celery publishes GAMEWEEK_PLANNING(trigger='48h')
  → Digger analyzes DC performers → DC_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE
  → Priya analyzes fixtures → FIXTURE_ANALYSIS_COMPLETED
  → Sophia analyzes xG → XG_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE
  → Jimmy combines all → VALUE_RANKINGS_COMPLETED

PRE-DEADLINE (24h):
  → RonManager receives VALUE_RANKINGS_COMPLETED
  → Caches rankings for decision-making

PRE-DEADLINE (6h):
  → Celery publishes GAMEWEEK_PLANNING(trigger='6h')
  → RonManager.make_weekly_decision():
    • Check cached intelligence from Scout
    • Run ML predictions (DecisionSynthesisEngine)
    • Evaluate transfers (TransferOptimizer)
    • Evaluate chips (ChipStrategyAnalyzer)
    • Make final decision
    • Publish TEAM_SELECTED event
  → Ellie (LearningAgent) logs decision
  → Slack/Telegram notification sent
```

## Files Changed

### Created/Modified
- ✅ `agents/manager_agent_v2.py` - Event-driven manager (complete)
- ✅ `scripts/pre_deadline_selection.py` - Uses RonManager
- ✅ `agents/__init__.py` - Exports RonManager as primary
- ✅ `docs/MANAGER_COMPARISON.md` - Detailed comparison
- ✅ `docs/EVENT_DRIVEN_ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE.md` - This file

### Deprecated
- ⚠️ `agents/manager_legacy.py` - Keep for reference, will remove later

---

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

### 1. Scout Intelligence Integration (ron_clanker-84)
Now that event architecture is complete, integrate Scout intelligence:
- Subscribe to INJURY_INTELLIGENCE events
- Use intelligence in transfer decisions
- Alert system for critical news

### 2. LLM Intelligence Classification (ron_clanker-83)
Replace keyword-based classification with Claude API:
- Better context understanding
- Nuanced confidence scoring
- Handle complex sentences

### 3. Additional Event Subscribers
Now that TEAM_SELECTED event publishes, create:
- Notification service (Slack/Discord)
- Historical analysis agent
- Performance tracking agent

### 4. Remove Legacy Manager
After testing period (GW10-12):
- Delete `agents/manager_legacy.py`
- Clean up any remaining references
- Full commit to event-driven

---

## Post-Phase 7 Enhancement

### LLM-Powered Team Announcements ✅

After completing Phase 7, we identified that team announcements were still using static templates instead of dynamic LLM generation like post-match reviews.

**Problem**: `_generate_team_announcement()` used f-string templates
**Solution**: Integrated Claude Haiku (via `llm_banter.py`)

**Changes**:
- Added `generate_team_announcement()` method to `llm_banter.py`
- Updated `RonManager._generate_team_announcement()` to use LLM
- Passes squad, transfers, chip usage to LLM for context
- Graceful fallback if API fails

**Result**: Natural, context-aware team announcements matching Ron's persona, just like post-match reviews.
