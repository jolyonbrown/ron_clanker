## üéØ Testing Notifications

Test the notification system:

```bash
# Test basic notification
venv/bin/python scripts/test_telegram_notifications.py

# Run a script manually to see notifications
venv/bin/python scripts/daily_scout.py
venv/bin/python scripts/predict_price_changes.py
```

## üîá Quiet Mode

If you want logs but no notifications, disable them:

```bash
export TELEGRAM_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false

The script will run normally but skip sending Telegram messages.

   ```bash
   venv/bin/python scripts/test_telegram_notifications.py
   ```

3. Check cron logs:
   ```bash
