## 💬 Ron's Take

*"Right, so we've got the tracking system sorted. Live scores, post-match analysis, staff meetings - the whole infrastructure.*

*Now comes the real test. Saturday, Gameweek 8. Haaland's got Everton at home. My DC lads are locked and loaded. We'll see if the strategy holds up when it matters.*

*The numbers say it should work. Maggie's data shows 20 DC points per week, guaranteed floor. Digger's convinced the defense will deliver. Sophia thinks we need more attackers - we'll see who's right.*

*Either way, we're tracking everything. Every decision, every outcome, every learning. That's how you improve. Small gains, week after week.*

*Two Points FC. Let's see what we're made of."*
