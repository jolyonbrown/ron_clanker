## What Ron Would Actually Choose:

*"Right, I've looked at your list. Half of it's nonsense I don't understand. 'Oscars'? 'Jay-Z'? What are you on about?*

*But 'Two Points FC' - that's proper. Says what we do. Bank two points from defensive work, week in week out. Foundation first.*

*Or 'Haaland & The Grafters'. I like that. He scores the goals, the other 14 do the work. That's football.*

*Maggie wants 'The Clearance Sale.' Says it's got 'wit.' I don't see it but she's usually right about this modern stuff.*

*Digger keeps shouting 'Tackles Before Dribbles' from across the room. Typical.*

*You're the chairman. You decide. Just don't make it embarrassing."*

---

## Final Recommendation:

### **"Two Points FC"** or **"Haaland & The Grafters"**

Both capture the essence:
- Strategy-focused
- Witty without being try-hard
- Ron would genuinely approve
- Makes a statement

**Backup:** "The Clearance Sale" (if you want maximum wit)

*What's it going to be, boss?*
