# Session Notes - October 5th, 2025 (Part 2)
## Team API Integration & Availability Monitoring

---

## üéØ Session Goals
Explore FPL Team API to understand how to track Ron's actual performance once registered.

---

## ‚úÖ What We Built

### 1. **Team API Explorer** (`scripts/explore_team_api.py`)

Explored all FPL team endpoints to understand available data:

**Endpoints Tested:**
- `/entry/{team_id}/` - Team overview (name, rank, points, value)
- `/entry/{team_id}/history/` - Season history (all GWs, chips used)
- `/entry/{team_id}/event/{gw}/picks/` - Squad for specific GW
- `/entry/{team_id}/transfers/` - All transfer history

**Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ Full access to team performance data
- ‚úÖ Gameweek-by-gameweek history (points, rank, value, bank)
- ‚úÖ Squad composition (player IDs, captain, bench)
- ‚úÖ Transfer history with timestamps
- ‚úÖ Chip usage tracking
- ‚ùå Player names not included (need to cross-reference with bootstrap)
- ‚ùå Individual player GW points not in picks endpoint (need separate fetch)

---

### 2. **Player Status Explorer** (`scripts/explore_player_status.py`)

Investigated FPL API player status fields:

**Status Codes Found:**
- `a` = Available (fully fit)
- `d` = Doubtful (fitness concern)
- `i` = Injured (ruled out)
- `s` = Suspended
- `u` = Unavailable (on loan, ineligible)
- `n` = Not in squad

**Additional Fields:**
- `news` - Text explanation of status
- `chance_of_playing_this_round` - % probability (0-100)
- `chance_of_playing_next_round` - % probability (0-100)

**Example from current data:**
- √òdegaard: Status `d`, "Knee injury - 75% chance of playing"
- Madueke: Status `i`, "Knee injury - Unknown return date"
- Hein: Status `u`, "Has joined Werder Bremen on loan"

---

### 3. **Squad Availability Checker** (`scripts/check_squad_availability.py`)

Monitors Ron's squad for injuries, suspensions, and availability issues.

**Features:**
- Checks all 15 players in squad against latest FPL API data
- Flags players with any status concerns
- Shows news, injury details, chance of playing percentages
- Returns exit code (0 = all clear, 1 = issues found)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Check GW8 squad
python scripts/check_squad_availability.py --squad gw8

# Verbose (show all players)
python scripts/check_squad_availability.py --squad gw8 --verbose
```

**Current GW8 Squad Status:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Gabriel: 75% chance this round (international duty concern)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Haaland: 100% both rounds (flagged but available)
- ‚úÖ All other players: Fully available

---

### 4. **Ron's Team Tracker** (`scripts/track_ron_team.py`) ‚≠ê

**Comprehensive team performance tracking system.**

**Features:**
- Fetches Ron's actual FPL team data via API
- Enriches player IDs with names, teams, positions from bootstrap
- Displays full season overview and GW-by-GW history
- Shows current squad with captain/vice-captain
- Tracks transfer history
- Detailed player-by-player performance (with `--verbose`)
- Saves tracking data to JSON files

**Configuration:**
- Team ID stored in `config/ron_config.json`
- Can override with `--team-id` flag
- Placeholder config created (team_id: null until Ron registered)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Basic tracking (uses config team ID)
python scripts/track_ron_team.py

# Specific team ID
python scripts/track_ron_team.py --team-id 123456

# Specific gameweek
python scripts/track_ron_team.py --gameweek 8

# Detailed player performance
python scripts/track_ron_team.py --verbose

# Save data to file
python scripts/track_ron_team.py --save
```

**Output Includes:**
1. **Team Overview**: Name, rank, points, value, chips used
2. **GW History**: Last 10 GWs (pts, rank, transfers, bench pts)
3. **Squad Details**: 15 players with prices, captain/VC marked
4. **Detailed Performance** (verbose): Goals, assists, DC, bonus per player
5. **Transfer History**: All transfers with player names

**Tested with example team (9204022):**
```

---

### 5. **Configuration System**

Created `config/ron_config.json`:
```json
{
  "team_id": null,
  "team_name": "Two Points FC",
  "manager_name": "Ron Clanker",
  "season": "2025/26",
  "entry_gameweek": 8,
  "notes": "Update team_id once Ron's team is registered"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Centralized team ID management
- No need to pass team ID to every script
- Easy to update once Ron registered
- Stores metadata about Ron's team

---

### 6. **Documentation**

Created `docs/TRACKING_RONS_TEAM.md`:
- Complete guide to team tracking system
- Setup instructions
- Usage examples
- API data availability reference
- Integration with other scripts
- Troubleshooting guide
- Workflow examples

---

## üîÑ Integration Points

### Existing Scripts Enhanced:
These scripts can now pull actual Ron team data:

1. **`track_gameweek_live.py`** - Can fetch Ron's actual squad
2. **`analyze_gw_results.py`** - Can use real results vs predictions
3. **`staff_meeting_report.py`** - Can include actual performance

### New Capabilities Unlocked:

1. **Automated Tracking**: Cron job to save daily snapshots
2. **Prediction Validation**: Compare predictions vs actual results
3. **Learning Loop**: Feed actual data back to ML models
4. **Performance Analytics**: Track Ron's rank progression
5. **Template Comparison**: Ron vs average/template analysis

---

## üéØ Typical Workflow (Once Ron Registered)

### Daily:
```bash
# Quick status check
python scripts/track_ron_team.py

# Check for injuries
python scripts/check_squad_availability.py --squad gw8
```

### During Gameweek (Sat/Sun):
```bash
# Live monitoring
python scripts/track_gameweek_live.py --gw 8 --watch
```

### Post-Gameweek (Monday):
```bash
# Full analysis
python scripts/track_ron_team.py --verbose --save
python scripts/analyze_gw_results.py --gw 8 --save-report
python scripts/staff_meeting_report.py --gw 8 --save
```

### Transfer Planning (Tue-Thu):
```bash
python scripts/analyze_transfer_targets.py --gw 9
python scripts/monitor_price_changes.py
```

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (Before GW8):
1. ‚úÖ Create placeholder squad (local only)
2. ‚è≥ Monitor international break for injuries
3. ‚è≥ 24-48hrs before deadline: Final squad optimization

### Once Ron Registered:
1. Update `config/ron_config.json` with team_id
2. Test `track_ron_team.py` with real data
3. Enable automated daily tracking

### Next Development Phase:
1. **Pre-deadline Optimizer** - Final 24hr squad check & optimization
2. **Transfer Analysis System** - GW9 transfer planning
3. **Captain Optimizer** - Data-driven captain selection
4. **Price Change Predictor** - Monitor rises/falls

## üí° Key Insights

### 1. **FPL API is Comprehensive**
Everything we need to track Ron's performance is available via public API endpoints. No authentication needed for basic team data.

### 2. **Player IDs Require Cross-Reference**
Picks endpoint returns player IDs only. Must cross-reference with bootstrap-static to get names, teams, positions. Our tracker handles this automatically.

### 3. **Detailed Stats Require Extra Fetches**
Getting individual player GW performance (goals, assists, DC) requires fetching each player's history separately. Verbose mode does this automatically.

### 4. **Status Flags are Rich**
FPL provides detailed availability info beyond just "injured/available". Percentage chances and news text give valuable context.

### 5. **Team Value Tracked Per GW**
Can build complete team value progression chart from history endpoint. Useful for tracking Jimmy's price change strategy success.

## üé≠ Ron's Take

*"Right, so now we can actually see how we're doing. No more guessing. Real numbers, real ranks, real points.*

*The API gives us everything - who played, who scored, who I left on the bench like a mug. That's accountability. That's learning.*

*Once we're registered for GW8, we track everything. Every decision, every outcome, every mistake. You don't get better without knowing where you went wrong.*

*Maggie will love this - proper data to work with. Ellie can finally do her learning loop properly. And I get to see if my gut instinct is worth a damn or if I should just let the computer pick the team.*

*Two weeks till GW8. Time to get serious."*
