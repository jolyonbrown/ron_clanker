# Pre-Deadline Optimizer
## Ron's Weekly Decision Engine

The pre-deadline optimizer is Ron's core weekly decision tool, used 24-48 hours before each gameweek deadline to make final squad decisions.

---

## Overview

**Purpose**: Re-analyze all data with latest information and provide optimized recommendations for:
- Squad selection (fresh start) or squad validation (standard mode)
- Transfer decisions (GW9+)
- Captain & vice-captain selection
- Formation & bench order

**Reusable**: Same script works for every gameweek throughout the season.

---

## Two Modes

### 1. Fresh Start Mode (GW8 Only)

For Ron's entry gameweek with full ¬£100m budget.

```bash
python scripts/pre_deadline_optimizer.py --gw 8 --fresh-start
```

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ Analyzes all 743 players with latest data
- ‚úÖ Selects best 15 within ¬£100m budget
- ‚úÖ Prioritizes DC specialists (70%+ consistency)
- ‚úÖ Includes premium attackers (Haaland, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Validates against 3-per-team rule
- ‚úÖ Optimizes value (points per ¬£m)
- ‚úÖ Selects captain & vice-captain
- ‚úÖ Sets formation (3-5-2 default)
- ‚úÖ Orders bench for auto-subs

### 2. Standard Mode (GW9-38)

For weekly optimization with transfers.

```bash
python scripts/pre_deadline_optimizer.py --gw 9
```

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ Loads current squad from latest squad file
- ‚úÖ Checks all players for injuries/suspensions
- ‚úÖ Analyzes transfer opportunities
- ‚úÖ Calculates expected value of transfers
- ‚úÖ Recommends hits (-4pts) if worth it
- ‚úÖ Plans multi-week transfers
- ‚úÖ Optimizes captain selection
- ‚úÖ Adjusts formation if needed

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# GW8 - Fresh start
python scripts/pre_deadline_optimizer.py --gw 8 --fresh-start

# GW9+ - Standard weekly optimization
python scripts/pre_deadline_optimizer.py --gw 9

# Save recommendations to file
python scripts/pre_deadline_optimizer.py --gw 8 --fresh-start --save

# Verbose output
python scripts/pre_deadline_optimizer.py --gw 9 --verbose
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Override free transfers (if you know you have 2)
python scripts/pre_deadline_optimizer.py --gw 10 --free-transfers 2

# Override budget (in millions)
python scripts/pre_deadline_optimizer.py --gw 9 --budget 2.5

# Combine options
python scripts/pre_deadline_optimizer.py --gw 12 --free-transfers 2 --budget 3.0 --save
```

Right, GW8. Fresh start. Here's the plan:

Selected 13 DC specialists - that's our foundation.

## Algorithm Details

### Fresh Start Squad Selection

**Strategy**:
1. Select 2 cheapest GKPs (maximize budget for outfield)
2. Select 3-4 top DC defenders (70%+ consistency)
3. Fill remaining DEF slots with value picks
4. Select 3-4 top DC midfielders
5. Add premium/attacking mids for ceiling
6. Select 1 premium forward (Haaland preferred)
7. Fill remaining FWD with budget options

**Constraints**:
- Total cost ‚â§ ¬£100m
- Exactly 2 GKP, 5 DEF, 5 MID, 3 FWD
- Max 3 players per team
- All players status = 'a' (available)

**Optimization Metric**:
- Value score = Points per game / Price
- DC specialists prioritized (guaranteed floor)
- Balance between floor (DC) and ceiling (premiums)

### Transfer Analysis (GW9+)

*Coming in Phase 3*

**Will consider**:
- Expected points next 3-6 GWs
- Fixture difficulty
- Price changes (maximize team value)
- Form trends
- Ownership (template vs differential)

**Decision criteria**:
- Only take -4 hit if expected gain > 6 pts over 3 GWs
- Plan transfers around fixture swings
- Bank transfers when no clear moves (max 5)

## Examples

### Example 1: GW8 Fresh Start
```bash
$ python scripts/pre_deadline_optimizer.py --gw 8 --fresh-start --save

Output:
- 15-player squad selected (13 DC specialists)
- ¬£89.4m spent, ¬£10.6m remaining
- Haaland captain, Semenyo vice
- 3-5-2 formation
- Saved to gw8_recommendations_*.json
```

### Example 2: GW9 Weekly Check
```bash
$ python scripts/pre_deadline_optimizer.py --gw 9

Output:
- Current squad loaded (15 players)
- 2 availability concerns flagged (Gabriel 75%, Haaland minor)
- Transfer analysis: No clear moves this week
- Captain: Haaland (best fixture)
- Recommendation: Hold transfers, monitor team news
```

### Example 3: GW12 with 2 Free Transfers
```bash
$ python scripts/pre_deadline_optimizer.py --gw 12 --free-transfers 2 --save

Output:
- 2 FT available (confirmed)
- Identified fixture swing for 2 players
- Recommended transfers:
  OUT: Player A (bad fixtures GW12-15)
  OUT: Player B (injury concern)
  IN: Player C (fixture swing)
  IN: Player D (form + fixtures)
- Expected gain: +8 pts over 4 GWs
- Execute both transfers
```

## Tips

### Best Practices:
1. **Run Early**: Tuesday/Wednesday to spot trends
2. **Run Often**: Daily as deadline approaches
3. **Save Output**: Track how recommendations evolve
4. **Check Diffs**: Compare Tuesday vs Friday recommendations
5. **Validate Manually**: Ron's gut + data = best decisions

### Common Issues:
- **"No squad file found"**: Normal for GW8, use --fresh-start
- **"Budget: None"**: Squad file missing budget info, use --budget flag
- **Different squad vs manual selection**: Algorithm is aggressive on DC, may differ from gut feel

### When to Override Algorithm:
- Team news breaks late (player suddenly ruled out)
- Gut feeling on differential captain
- Price changes force different picks
- Fixture postponement announced
