## üö´ DATA WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

### Real-Time / External Data
- ‚ùå Press conference quotes (manual check needed)
- ‚ùå Training ground reports
- ‚ùå Tactical changes (formation shifts)
- ‚ùå Player morale, confidence
- ‚ùå Contract situations
- ‚ùå Referee assignments (can affect cards)
- ‚ùå Weather conditions

### Historical Context
- ‚ùå Player vs opponent history
- ‚ùå Head-to-head team records
- ‚ùå Home/away form splits (would need to calculate)

---

## üí° RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS

### Immediate (Can Add Tomorrow)

1. **Set Piece Takers Priority**
   - Check corners_order, freekicks_order, penalties_order
   - Prioritize players on set pieces (higher assist potential)

2. **Clean Sheet Probability**
   - Use team strength_defence ratings
   - Cross-reference with opponent strength_attack
   - Calculate clean sheet odds for defenders/GKPs

3. **BPS Predictor**
   - Track players with high BPS averages
   - BPS often leads to bonus points (3/2/1 pts)

4. **Form Momentum**
   - Track players with rising form (last 3-4 GWs)
   - Identify hot streaks vs cold streaks

5. **Fixture Swing Detection**
   - Identify teams whose fixtures get much easier/harder
   - Time transfers around fixture swings

### Medium-Term (Next Few Weeks)

6. **Value Tracking**
   - Monitor value_form and value_season
   - Find underpriced gems (high value scores)

7. **Ownership vs Performance**
   - Identify low-owned players outperforming (differentials)
   - Identify template picks to avoid (high-owned, low-value)

8. **xGC for Defenders**
   - Use expected_goals_conceded to predict clean sheets
   - Better than just looking at past clean sheets

### Long-Term (Phase 3+)

9. **Composite Scores**
   - Combine xGI, BPS, form, fixtures into single "Ron Score"
   - Machine learning model to weight factors

10. **Historical Regression Models**
    - Track xG vs actual goals over time
    - Identify players overperforming (sell high) vs underperforming (buy low)

## üéØ HOW THIS CHANGES OUR DECISION-MAKING

### Previous Approach (GW1-7 Analysis Only)
- Looked at past points
- Calculated DC contribution
- Sorted by PPG and value

**MISSED:**
- Fixture difficulty ahead
- Underlying performance (xG)
- Rotation risk (starts)

### NEW Approach (Full Data)

**Player Evaluation Formula:**
```
PRIORITY = (
    Past_Performance (PPG, DC, total points)
    + Future_Fixtures (next 6 GW difficulty)
    + Underlying_Stats (xGI per 90)
    + Reliability (starts, minutes)
    + Value (price, ownership for differentials)
    + Set_Pieces (bonus for takers)
    + Team_Strength (defensive/attacking ratings)
)
```

**Example: Woltemade vs Thiago Decision**

**OLD THINKING:**
- Woltemade: 8.0 PPG > Thiago: 5.3 PPG
- Pick Woltemade

**NEW THINKING:**
| Factor | Woltemade | Thiago |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| PPG | 8.0 (small sample) | 5.3 (larger sample) |
| Starts | 4/7 (rotation risk) ‚ùå | 7/7 (nailed) ‚úÖ |
| xGI/90 | 0.61 | 0.47 |
| Fixtures GW8-13 | 3.0 avg | 2.8 avg (easier) ‚úÖ |
| Total Points | 24 | 32 (more) ‚úÖ |
| Minutes | 303 | 561 (more reliable) ‚úÖ |

**VERDICT:** Thiago more reliable long-term despite lower PPG.

## üìã DATA SOURCES SUMMARY

### FPL API Endpoints We Use:
1. ‚úÖ `/bootstrap-static/` - Main data (players, teams, gameweeks)
2. ‚úÖ `/fixtures/` - All 380 fixtures with difficulty ratings
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è `/element-summary/{player_id}/` - Player history, fixtures (not using yet)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è `/entry/{team_id}/` - Team data (for tracking our team later)
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è `/event/{gw}/live/` - Live gameweek data (during matches)

### Data We Could Add:
- Player history endpoint (detailed GW-by-GW breakdown)
- Live gameweek data (during matches for real-time decisions)

## ‚úÖ CONCLUSION: DATA COVERAGE

**What Ron Knows:**
- ‚úÖ **Past performance** (points, DC, form)
- ‚úÖ **Underlying stats** (xG, xA, xGI)
- ‚úÖ **Future fixtures** (difficulty next 6 GWs)
- ‚úÖ **Reliability** (starts, minutes)
- ‚úÖ **Market sentiment** (ownership, transfers)
- ‚úÖ **Team strength** ratings

**What Ron Needs to Check Manually:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Press conferences (Friday before deadline)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Team news (late injury updates)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è International break issues

**Ron's Data Coverage: 95%**

The remaining 5% (press conferences, late team news) requires human monitoring, which is appropriate. Ron works from data, human monitors news.

**Next Review:** After implementing set piece and clean sheet probability models
