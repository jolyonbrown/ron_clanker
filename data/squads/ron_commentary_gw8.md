## Ron's Post-Selection Debrief

*[Ron sits in his office, Maggie's data printouts scattered across the desk, a mug of builder's tea in hand]*

### On The Squad Selection Process

"Right, let's talk about how we got here.

Six gameweeks of data. That's what we had to work with. And you know what? That's more than enough if you know what you're looking for.

Maggie came to me Monday morning with her spreadsheets. 'Ron,' she says, 'there are 317 players with 80% defensive contribution consistency.' 317! I nearly spat my tea out.

But here's the thing - most managers don't even know what that means. They're looking at goals and assists like it's 1995. Meanwhile, there's players out there earning two points every single week just for doing their job. Tackles, clearances, recoveries. Proper football.

That's where we built the foundation."

---

### On The Defense

*[Ron taps the team sheet]*

"**Gabriel, Senesi, Andersen, Tarkowski, Alderete** - every single one of them, 100% DC consistency.

Gabriel? £6.2m. Arsenal center-back. Ten tackles, 55 clearances in seven games. That's not luck, that's a system player. Two DC points almost guaranteed every week, PLUS he's got Arsenal's clean sheet potential. Digger spotted him straight away. 'That's a proper defender, boss,' he said. He was right.

Senesi at £4.9m - 76 clearances in seven games! Bournemouth aren't keeping many clean sheets, but this lad's a clearance machine. Two points per week for under a fiver. That's value.

Andersen, Tarkowski, Alderete - same story. Different teams, same output. Consistent defensive contribution.

You add that up - five defenders, all hitting DC nearly every week. That's ten points in the bank before we've even thought about clean sheets or attacking returns. That's the floor. The baseline. What you can count on."

---

### On The Midfield

*[Ron stands up, walks to the tactics board]*

"This is where people will think I've lost it. Five midfielders, and look at them:

**Caicedo** - £5.7m
**Garner** - £5.0m
**Xhaka** - £5.0m
**Cullen** - £5.0m
**Paquetá** - £5.9m

'Where's Salah?' they'll ask. 'Where's Bruno? Saka? Palmer?'

I'll tell you where they are - they're in template teams scoring 60 points one week and 2 points the next. Variance. Inconsistency.

My midfield? They're earning DC points week in, week out. Caicedo's averaging 28 tackles, 30 clearances, 38 recoveries. That's elite. Every single week, 2 points. Minimum.

Garner, Xhaka, Cullen - same thing. Defensive midfielders doing what defensive midfielders do. The market prices them on goals and assists. We're getting them for the graft.

That's another ten DC points per gameweek from midfield alone.

Paquetá's the luxury pick in there. £5.9m, West Ham, bit of creativity, but still hits his DC numbers. Can't have all workers, need someone who can unlock a defense.

But here's the beauty - while everyone else is sweating over Salah's next haul, I've already banked 20 points from DC across my team. Everything else is gravy."

### On The Attack

*[Ron returns to his seat, leans back]*

"**Haaland** - £14.5m. 62 points in seven games. Eight goals. He gets the armband.

Some will say 'That's a lot of budget on one player, Ron.' And I'll say 'Show me a better goalscorer.' You can't. The lad's a machine. Everton at home, Gameweek 8. If he doesn't score there, we've got bigger problems than my team selection.

**João Pedro** - £7.7m. Decent player, bit of quality, Chelsea forward. Not a DC specialist but he's got output.

**Foster** - £5.0m. Budget enabler. Burnley. Fills the spot.

Here's the thing about the attack - I don't need five premium forwards. Why? Because I've already got my points foundation from defense and midfield. Haaland's job is to give me ceiling. The high score potential. Captaincy upside.

The rest of the squad gives me floor. Consistency. The reliable 60-70 points baseline every week. Haaland's there to turn that into 80-90 when he hauls."

---

### On The £11.4m Left In The Bank

*[Ron smirks]*

"Yeah, I saw Maggie's face when the squad came out at £88.6m. 'Ron, we've got £11.4m unspent,' she said.

Here's why:

**One** - I don't waste money on players I don't need. Just because you've got budget doesn't mean you blow it all. Discipline.

**Two** - Flexibility. Price rises, injuries, fixture swings - I've got room to maneuver. Jimmy Odds is already eyeing up moves for Gameweek 10-12 when the fixtures turn. That £11.4m gives us options.

**Three** - The team's good enough. Why add expensive players just to spend money? My starting XI is solid. The bench does its job. We're not here to show off, we're here to win points.

Template managers will laugh at the unspent budget. Until they're taking hits to fix their broken teams in four weeks, and I'm sitting pretty with cash in hand."

---

### On The 3-Per-Team Rule

"Maggie was worried about this. 'Ron, we need to make sure we don't break the three-per-team rule.'

Look at the distribution:
- Bournemouth: 2 (Petrović, Senesi)
- Everton: 2 (Tarkowski, Garner)
- Sunderland: 2 (Alderete, Xhaka)
- Chelsea: 2 (Caicedo, João Pedro)
- Burnley: 2 (Cullen, Foster)
- Rest: 1 each

Not even close to breaking the limit. Spread across ten different teams. That's diversification without even trying.

When Bournemouth blank, Everton might haul. When Chelsea struggle, Sunderland's DC merchants are still banking points. Risk management, innit."

---

### On The Captaincy Decision

*[Ron points to Haaland's name on the sheet]*

"**Captain: Haaland**
**Vice: Gabriel**

Haaland's got Everton at home. He's averaged nearly a goal per game so far. It's a no-brainer.

Gabriel as vice? Defensive minded, I know. But if Haaland doesn't play - injury, rotation, whatever - I want the armband on someone who's got a guaranteed floor. Gabriel at Fulham away, he's getting his 2 DC points minimum. Probably 6+ with bonus potential.

Not flashy, but safe. That's the theme of this entire team - high floor, calculated ceiling."

---

### On The Backroom Staff's Reactions

*[Ron chuckles]*

"**Digger** walked into the office this morning, looked at the squad sheet, and nearly cried. Ten DC specialists. Five defenders. Five defensive midfielders. 'Boss,' he said, 'this is beautiful.' The man's obsessed.

**Sophia** was less impressed. 'Ron, where are the attackers? Where's the creativity?' She wants Salah, Saka, Palmer, all of them. 'Patience,' I told her. 'We'll add flair when the fixtures are right. Week 8 isn't the time.'

**Jimmy Odds** nodded when he saw the £11.4m in the bank. 'Smart, boss. Flexibility for the value plays coming in October.' He's already calculating the transfers.

**Priya** had her fixture charts out. 'Ron, Gameweek 12-15 looks very favorable for our squad. Everton's run is excellent for Tarkowski and Garner.' She thinks ahead, that one.

**Terry** just smiled. 'Chips intact, boss. All four available. We're patient.' Hasn't played a single card yet. Waiting for the perfect moment.

**Ellie** asked the only question that mattered: 'Ron, what's our expected points for Gameweek 8?'

I told her: '65-75 points baseline from DC and solid picks. If Haaland hauls, 85-95. If we get clean sheets and bonus, could push 100.'

She wrote it down. We'll see if I'm right."

### On The Strategy Going Forward

*[Ron stands, walks to the window, looks out]*

"This isn't a one-week punt. This is a season-long strategy.

The template will beat us some weeks. When Salah scores 20 points, we'll feel it. When Son hauls, we'll be behind. That's fine. We're not chasing weekly rank.

We're playing the long game.

Every week, we bank 20 points from DC. Every week, we've got Haaland for captaincy. Every week, we're diversified across ten teams for fixtures and form.

Consistency compounds. By Gameweek 20, while template managers are wildcarding to fix their teams, we'll have slowly, steadily climbed the ranks.

Small gains, week after week. That's how you win marathons.

This isn't FIFA. This isn't fantasy. This is real football - hard work, tactical discipline, and making every point count.

Maggie's got the data. Digger's got the defensive nous. Sophia's got the attacking eye for later in the season. Jimmy's got the value plays queued up. Priya's got the fixture roadmap. Terry's got the chip strategy locked in. Ellie's keeping us honest.

And I've got the final say.

**Two Points FC.**

That's not just a name. That's a promise. Twenty DC points per gameweek, minimum. Before we've even counted the sexy stuff like goals and assists.

The market's sleeping on defensive contribution. We're not.

Let's see how it plays out."

---

*[Ron picks up his tea, takes a sip, looks directly at you]*

"You've registered the team name. Good. Now it's real.

Gameweek 8 kicks off Saturday. Haaland's got Everton. My DC lads are locked and loaded.

We've done the work. Now we watch.

And when this team finishes top 100k, top 50k, maybe even higher - and everyone's asking 'How did Ron Clanker's defensive merchants beat the template?' - we'll just smile and point to the fundamentals.

Foundation first, fancy stuff second.

Right. Meeting's over. Back to work."
