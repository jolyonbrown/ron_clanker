RON CLANKER'S GAMEWEEK 8 SQUAD ANNOUNCEMENT
================================================================================

Right lads, here's how we're setting up for Gameweek 8.

Fresh start. Clean slate. £100m to build something proper.

I've spent the last week analyzing the data - all seven gameweeks worth.
And I'll tell you what I've found: while everyone else is chasing last
week's goals, there's points being left on the table every single week
from defensive work. Those new rules about tackles and clearances? That's
our edge.

================================================================================
THE SQUAD
================================================================================

BETWEEN THE STICKS:

  1. Vicario (£5.1m) - AVL (at home)
     35 points so far. Solid.
  2. Petrović (£4.5m) - CRY (away)

THE BACK LINE:

  1. Gabriel (£6.2m) - FUL (A) ⭐
     DC specialist. 47 points. 10 tackles, 55 clearances.
  2. Senesi (£4.9m) - CRY (A) ⭐
     DC specialist. 46 points. 12 tackles, 76 clearances.
  3. Andersen (£4.5m) - ARS (H) ⭐
     DC specialist. 29 points. 15 tackles, 66 clearances.
  4. Tarkowski (£5.5m) - MCI (A) ⭐
     DC specialist. 27 points. 10 tackles, 58 clearances.
  5. Alderete (£4.1m) - WOL (H) ✓
     DC specialist. 39 points. 11 tackles, 53 clearances.

MIDFIELD ENGINE ROOM:

  1. Caicedo (£5.7m) - NFO (A) ⭐
     45 pts. Defensive work: 28 tackles, 30 CBI, 38 recoveries.
  2. Garner (£5.0m) - MCI (A) ⭐
     32 pts. Defensive work: 17 tackles, 29 CBI, 27 recoveries.
  3. Xhaka (£5.0m) - WOL (H) ⭐
     32 pts. Defensive work: 12 tackles, 41 CBI, 36 recoveries.
  4. Cullen (£5.0m) - LEE (H) ⭐
     31 pts. Defensive work: 7 tackles, 37 CBI, 22 recoveries.
  5. L.Paquetá (£5.9m) - BRE (H) ⭐
     31 pts. Defensive work: 19 tackles, 13 CBI, 34 recoveries.

UP FRONT:

  1. Haaland (£14.5m) - EVE (H) (C)
     62 points, 8 goals. Main man.
  2. João Pedro (£7.7m) - NFO (A)
  3. Foster (£5.0m) - LEE (H)

================================================================================
THE GAFFER'S LOGIC
================================================================================

This team is built on a simple principle: foundation first, fancy stuff second.

**10 DEFENSIVE CONTRIBUTION SPECIALISTS** in the squad. That's players who
are earning 2 points from tackles and clearances nearly every week. The market
hasn't caught on yet - they're still pricing them on goals and assists.

Do the math: 10 players x 2 DC points = 20 points per gameweek BEFORE we've
even counted goals, assists, or clean sheets. That's our floor. Our baseline.

Meanwhile, we've got Haaland leading the line. 62 points
in 7 games. He gets the armband for Gameweek 8.

CAPTAIN: Haaland (C)
VICE-CAPTAIN: Gabriel (VC)

Reasoning: Haaland's fixture looks favorable. If he can't score this
week, we've got bigger problems.

FORMATION: 3-5-2
- Three at the back, all earning defensive contribution points
- Five in midfield - mix of workers and creators
- Two up top for the goals

BUDGET: £88.6m spent, £11.4m remaining
CHIPS AVAILABLE: All chips available (2 Wildcards, 2 Bench Boosts, 2 Free Hits, 2 Triple Captains)
CHIP USAGE THIS WEEK: None - saving for when we need it

================================================================================
THE STRATEGY
================================================================================

While everyone else is template-chasing and reacting to last week's hauls,
we're building something sustainable. High floor from defensive work,
high ceiling from premium attackers.

Six gameweeks of data don't lie. The players in this squad have PROVEN
they can deliver. Now it's time to see if the strategy holds up.

Fortune favours the brave, but championships are won with discipline.

Let's get to work.

- Ron
