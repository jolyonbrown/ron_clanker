# Ron's GW7 Team - The One That Could Have Been

**What If Ron Had Started From GW7?**

---

## Ron's Reaction to His Hypothetical GW7 Squad

*[Ron stares at the team sheet, a slight smile crossing his face]*

"So you're asking me - what if we'd started at Gameweek 7 instead of 8? What would the team have looked like?

Let me tell you - it would've been beautiful.

## Ron's Analysis

### "The Perfect Example of The Strategy"

*[Ron leans forward, tapping the team sheet]*

"Look at this squad. THIRTEEN out of fifteen players with 100% defensive contribution consistency through the first six gameweeks. Thirteen!

That's 26 guaranteed DC points per gameweek before we've kicked a ball. Twenty-six points in the bank, week in, week out.

And you know what? It's actually BETTER than the GW8 squad we just picked."

---

### On The Key Differences

**GW7 Squad vs GW8 Squad:**

"The GW7 team is sharper. More aggressive. Why?

**Semenyo** - £7.9m midfielder with 66 points in 6 games AND 100% DC consistency. That's a premium DC midfielder who's also delivering goals and assists. In the GW8 squad, I went defensive mids only. Here, I've got Semenyo giving me both.

**Three Arsenal defenders** - Timber, Gabriel, Calafiori. That's... well, that's bold. Breaks my usual rule about not loading up on one team. But look at the numbers - all three, 100% DC, Arsenal's clean sheet potential, Calafiori at £5.7m is a steal. Sometimes the data forces your hand.

Wait, hang on..."

*[Ron counts on his fingers]*

"That's THREE Arsenal players. We're within the limit. Just. Probably wouldn't have done it if we didn't have the room, but the DC consistency demanded it.

**Roefs** - £4.6m Sunderland keeper with 41 points in 6 games. Budget option performing like a premium. Value.

**Kudus** - In the GW7 team. £6.7m, Tottenham, 39 points, 100% DC. Attacking midfielder who does the dirty work too. Perfect blend. He's not in the GW8 squad because we went even more defensive. But here? He fits perfectly.

**Gravenberch** - Liverpool midfielder, £5.7m, 37 points, 100% DC. Exactly what we want. Consistent defensive work, occasional attacking returns.

The whole midfield five: Semenyo, Caicedo, Anthony, Kudus, Gravenberch - every single one hitting DC targets every week. That's ten DC points from midfield alone. Guaranteed.

### On What This Team Would Have Done in GW7

*[Ron pulls out Maggie's GW7 results sheet]*

"Right, let's see what actually happened in Gameweek 7:

**Roefs** - Clean sheet vs Fulham. Probably 6-7 points.

**Timber** - 2 points (played but no attacking returns, probably got DC).

**Gabriel** - Probably similar, 2-4 points with DC.

**Senesi** - This lad gets his clearances every week. 2 DC points minimum.

**Semenyo** - Bournemouth vs Crystal Palace... 66 points in 6 games means he's in form. Could've hauled.

**Caicedo** - Chelsea defense. 2 DC points, maybe more if he got bonus.

**Haaland (C)** - Let me check... *[flips through notes]* ...Haaland in GW7...

Actually, you know what? I don't even need to check. With thirteen players all hitting DC, even if Haaland blanked, we're looking at 26 DC points, plus clean sheets, plus incidental returns.

That's probably 60-70 points MINIMUM. If Haaland scored, if Semenyo got an attacking return, if Arsenal kept a clean sheet - we're talking 80+.

The floor is sky-high with this team."

---

### On The £2.9m Left in the Bank

"Even less unspent than the GW8 squad! £2.9m remaining.

That's not indecision, that's precision. We've built exactly what we need. The £2.9m is a buffer for price changes, maybe one upgrade when the fixtures turn.

Maggie would approve. Jimmy Odds would call it 'tight value extraction.'

I call it not wasting money on players we don't need."

---

### On The Bench Strength

*[Ron points to the bench names]*

"**Vicario, Guéhi, Calafiori, Thiago**

That's not a bench, that's a second team!

Vicario - 35 points in 6 games. Rotating keeper who's delivering.

Guéhi and Calafiori - BOTH 100% DC defenders. First bench options. One injury to the starting XI and we're bringing on a DC specialist, not some £4.0m fodder.

Thiago - Brentford forward, 30 points in 6 games, 100% DC. A FORWARD with defensive contribution! That's rare. Perfect bench option who can slot in and still deliver baseline points.

This bench could outscore some teams' starting XIs."

---

### On The Formation

"**3-5-2** - Same as the GW8 squad.

Why? Because it works.

Three at the back - all DC specialists, all capable of clean sheet points.

Five in midfield - the engine room. Where the real work happens. Five DC midfielders churning out points every week.

Two up front - Haaland for the goals, João Pedro for support and more DC (yes, even the forwards have DC!).

It's not revolutionary. It's fundamental. But when you pick the RIGHT players for each position, fundamentals win championships."

### On The Differences From GW8

*[Ron compares the two team sheets side by side]*

"The GW8 squad is more defensive. Five defensive midfielders - Caicedo, Garner, Xhaka, Cullen, Paquetá. Not a creative bone among them.

The GW7 squad? Semenyo gives us goals. Kudus gives us creativity. It's still DC-focused, but there's more attacking threat.

Why the difference?

**One more gameweek of data.** By GW8, I could see which attackers were sustainable and which were flashes in the pan. Semenyo had proven himself by GW6, but by GW8, maybe his numbers dipped, or the fixtures turned, or Maggie's models showed regression coming.

Or maybe..." *[Ron pauses]* "...maybe I got more cautious. Went even safer. The GW7 squad shows I was willing to bet on attacking DC players. The GW8 squad shows I pulled back to pure defensive merchants.

Could be I saw something in the data. Could be I second-guessed myself. We'll never know because we didn't actually play GW7."

---

### On Which Team Is Better

*[Ron sits back, thinking]*

"The GW7 squad is probably the better team.

More balance. More attacking threat. Still 13 DC specialists so the floor is even higher. Semenyo and Kudus add ceiling without sacrificing the foundation.

But you know what? The GW8 squad is safer. More disciplined. Five defensive mids, absolute floor maximization.

The GW7 team would probably score more points on average. But it might also have higher variance - if Semenyo blanks, if Kudus disappoints.

The GW8 team is lower ceiling but rock-solid floor. Every week, 20 DC points minimum, no exceptions.

It's the difference between playing to win and playing not to lose.

I chose not to lose with the GW8 squad. The GW7 team was me playing to win.

Maybe that's age. Maybe that's wisdom. Maybe I just got scared."

*[Ron chuckles]*

"Or maybe Sophia got to me more than I admitted, and by GW8 I overcorrected back to pure defense."

### What The Staff Would Say

**Digger**: *"Boss, THIRTEEN DC specialists? This is even better than the GW8 team! We could've started at GW7!"*

**Sophia**: *"Finally, some attacking players! Semenyo, Kudus - this is what I've been asking for! Why didn't you keep this approach for GW8?"*

**Maggie**: *"The GW7 team has higher expected points but also higher variance. The GW8 team is statistically more conservative. Both are valid approaches."*

**Jimmy Odds**: *"GW7 team is the value play. Better points per £m. GW8 is the safe bet. Depends if you're chasing or protecting a lead."*

**Priya**: *"Both teams have good fixture coverage. GW7 perhaps slightly more fixture-proof due to spread across more attacking players."*

**Ellie**: *"This is fascinating, Ron. The GW7 team shows you were willing to take more risk early. By GW8, you became more conservative. That tells us something about your decision-making psychology."*

**Ron**: *"It tells you I'm getting soft in my old age, that's what it tells you."*

---

### The Verdict

*[Ron stands up, hands the two team sheets to you]*

"If I could go back? I'd start with the GW7 team.

Thirteen DC specialists, better attacking balance, Semenyo and Kudus adding firepower while still hitting defensive targets.

But we didn't start at GW7. We started at GW8. And the team we picked is good enough.

Both teams prove the same point: **Defensive contribution is the edge everyone's missing.**

GW7 exploits it with attacking balance.
GW8 exploits it with pure defense.

Either way, we're ahead of the template.

Now stop asking me about teams I didn't pick and let's focus on making sure the GW8 squad delivers.

**Two Points FC** isn't just a name. It's a promise. And we're keeping it."

---

*[Ron pauses at the door]*

"Although... Semenyo at £7.9m with 66 points and 100% DC... that's special.

Sophia, make a note. When his fixtures turn good again, we're bringing him in. That's a transfer target for October.

Right. NOW we're done."

**End of GW7 Hypothetical Analysis**

*"The team that could have been. But the team we have is the team we trust."*
