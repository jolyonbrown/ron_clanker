GAMEWEEK 11 - RON'S PICKS

Right. Here's the team.

GK: Ramsdale
DEF: Guéhi, Senesi, Gabriel, Richards
MID: Semenyo, Cullen, Ndiaye, João Pedro
FWD: Thiago, Haaland

4-3-3. No transfers. Got 2 free hits and £4.2m in the bank - nothing worth moving for this week.

Haaland gets the armband. City at home, 9.1 xP last five.
Guéhi vice. Differential in a soft fixture.

No chips.
