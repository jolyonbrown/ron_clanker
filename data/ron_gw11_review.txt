Alright lads, 57 points this week and that's what I call a proper performance. Nineteen clear of the average - the algorithms know what they're doing when you let them work, fuck about with emotional picks and you're done for.

Guéhi as captain was bollocks, I'll admit it. Regression to the mean said he was due a haul but the data didn't account for him being a lazy bastard. However, João Pedro as VC saved my arse - that's why you trust the process and have contingencies built in. Richards solid, Haaland doing his thing. That's the fundamentals right there.

The models are picking up some proper value picks for next week. Everyone's chasing the same five names and getting fucked over - I'm looking at the expected value on the players nobody's touching. That's where the points are.

Listen, whoever's leading the league - enjoy it while it lasts mate. The variance will catch you eventually. This is a long game and I'm playing it like chess, not darts. The data doesn't lie.

Right, I'm having a pint and a cigar. You cunts better be ready for next week because I'm just getting warmed up.
