RON'S COMMENTARY
================================================================================

Right lads, here's how we're lining up for Gameweek 8...

BETWEEN THE STICKS: Roefs
Solid keeper. £4.6m well spent.

THE BACK LINE: Senesi, Guéhi, Gabriel
This is where we're different. These lads do the dirty work - tackles,
blocks, clearances. Defensive contribution points every week. That's a
high floor. Foundation first.

MIDFIELD ENGINE ROOM: Semenyo, Sarr, Cullen, Ndiaye, Garner
Mix of defensive graft and attacking threat. Some of these will earn DC
points, others are there for goals and assists. Balanced.

UP FRONT: Haaland, Thiago
Semenyo gets the armband.

THE GAFFER'S LOGIC:
Jimmy's given me the rankings. Digger's found the DC specialists. Priya's
checked the fixtures. Sophia's identified the threats. I've weighed it all
up and made the call.

We're building for the long haul. High floors, smart picks, within budget.

Squad value: £94.7m
