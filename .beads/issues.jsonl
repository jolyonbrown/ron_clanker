MODEL IMPROVEMENT WORKFLOW:\n   Weekly cycle:\n   a) Collect GW results\n   b) Compare predictions vs actual (automated report)\n   c) Update training weights/features based on errors\n   d) Retrain with learnings incorporated\n   e) Track if accuracy improves week-over-week\n\n4. METRICS DASHBOARD:\n   - Overall MAE trend (are we improving?)\n   - MAE by position (GK/DEF/MID/FWD)\n   - MAE by price bracket (premium vs budget)\n   - Feature importance evolution (which stats matter most?)\n   - Confidence calibration (are high-confidence predictions more accurate?)\n\n5. AUTOMATED LEARNING:\n   - Adjust feature weights based on prediction errors\n   - Identify and add new features if gaps found\n   - Tune hyperparameters based on recent performance\n   - Consider ensemble weighting (give more weight to recent accurate models)\n\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n- Create scripts/analyze_prediction_accuracy.py\n- Run after each GW as part of pipeline\n- Store learnings in learning_metrics table\n- Use insights to improve next week's model training\n- Track MAE target: Start at ~2.5 pts, aim for \u003c2.0 pts\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Week-over-week MAE improvement visible\n- Systematic biases identified and corrected\n- Model adapts to season changes (fatigue, form shifts, DGW patterns)\n- Ron gets smarter every week!\n\nRELATED:\n- Uses existing player_predictions and learning_metrics tables\n- Complements ron_clanker-95 (news/opinion) by quantifying what stats miss\n- Essential for autonomous improvement without human intervention\n\nPRIORITY: P0 - Core to becoming better over time, not just static","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-23T23:30:33.842110594+01:00","updated_at":"2025-10-23T23:30:33.842110594+01:00"}
