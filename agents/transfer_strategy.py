"""
Transfer Strategy Agent - "Hugo"

Plans multi-week transfer strategy for Ron Clanker's FPL team.

Hugo's Responsibilities:
- Track free transfer bank (max 5)
- Decide when to roll vs use free transfers
- Plan 3-week rolling transfer strategy
- Calculate -4 point hit value (only if EV > 4pts over 3 GWs)
- Identify transfer targets based on fixture swings
- Sequence transfers optimally (urgent first)
- Respond to intelligence alerts (injuries, rotation, suspensions)
- Generate urgent transfers when squad players affected

FPL Transfer Rules:
- 1 free transfer per gameweek
- Max 5 free transfers can be banked
- Each additional transfer = -4 points
- Special: GW15→GW16 everyone gets 5 FTs (AFCON)
- Wildcard/Free Hit preserves banked transfers
