Decision Synthesis Engine - The Brain

Integrates all intelligence sources and ML predictions to generate
unified, context-aware recommendations for team decisions.

This is the critical integration layer that connects:
- ML predictions (expected points)
- League intelligence (competitive position, rivals)
- Global rankings (elite template)
- Fixture analysis (difficulty swings, DGW/BGW)
- Chip strategy (optimal timing)
- Price predictions (transfer urgency)

Output: Structured recommendations for Manager Agent
