"""
Consolidated Post-Gameweek Data Collection

THE authoritative script for collecting all post-gameweek data.
Runs daily via cron (02:35), exits early if GW not finished yet.

Collects:
1. Player gameweek history (actual points, stats)
2. League standings (ranks, points)
3. Rival team picks (who picked what)

Features:
- Incremental: Only fetches new gameweek data
- Idempotent: Safe to run multiple times
- Fast: ~30-40 seconds (only players who played)
- Validated: Checks data quality, logs warnings

Usage:
    python scripts/collect_post_gameweek_data.py
    python scripts/collect_post_gameweek_data.py --force  # Ignore GW finished check
