BETWEEN THE STICKS: Raya
Solid keeper. Arsenal defense has been rock solid.

THE BACK LINE: Gabriel (C), Timber, Saliba
This is where we're different. Gabriel's averaging 11 tackles and
clearances per game. That's 2 guaranteed points from Defensive
Contribution nearly every week. The market's still pricing them
on goals and assists. We're smarter than that.

MIDFIELD ENGINE ROOM: Caicedo, Rice, Saka, Palmer, Son
Caicedo and Rice - proper midfielders. 12+ defensive actions most
weeks. Another 4 points from DC every gameweek.

UP FRONT: Haaland, Watkins
Haaland gets the armband.

THE GAFFER'S LOGIC:
Five players earning Defensive Contribution points week in, week out.
That's 10 guaranteed points before we've even counted goals and assists.
Foundation first, fancy stuff second.

RON'S POST-MATCH THOUGHTS - GAMEWEEK 8
======================================================================
*Lights cigar, pours a pint, settles into the chair*

Right. 67 bloody points. THAT'S how you do it! 12 above average.
The plan worked, lads. Absolutely worked.

======================================================================
THE PREMIER LEAGUE
======================================================================
‚Ä¢ City 5-0 Bournemouth - Haaland hat-trick. Expected.
‚Ä¢ Arsenal 0-0 Everton - Absolute snooze fest.

======================================================================
MINI-LEAGUE SITUATION
======================================================================
League: The Gaffer's League
Position: 4 of 14

Two places up from last week. 15 points behind Jenkins at the top.
Right in the mix. This is ours for the taking.

======================================================================
MY LOT - THE BRUTALLY HONEST ASSESSMENT
======================================================================
‚úì Captain Haaland: 15 points
  That's what I'm talking about. Captain choice was spot on.

HEROES:
  ‚Ä¢ Haaland: 15 points - Hat-trick, that's why he's the captain
  ‚Ä¢ Gabriel: 9 points - Clean sheet + defensive contribution, exactly the plan

VILLAINS:
  ‚Ä¢ Mbeumo: 2 points - Full 90, did nothing. Out next week.

======================================================================
Overall Rank: 247,892
Top 250k. That's the standard.

======================================================================
THE VERDICT
======================================================================
Good weekend. The data worked, the picks delivered, job done.
This is what happens when you trust the fundamentals.

*Takes satisfied puff of cigar*

Right. That's enough analysis for one night.
Next gameweek is what matters now.
