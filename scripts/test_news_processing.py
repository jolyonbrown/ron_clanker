        'title': 'Haaland and Palmer lead FPL picks for Gameweek 9',
        'content': '''
        Erling Haaland continues his remarkable form and is the standout captain choice
        for Gameweek 9. The Manchester City striker has scored in his last three games
        and faces Aston Villa at home. With 6 goals in his last 4 matches, Haaland
        is a must-have for any serious FPL manager.

        Cole Palmer is another excellent option. Chelsea's midfielder has been
        exceptional, contributing goals and assists regularly. Chelsea face Sunderland
        at home, which should be a favorable fixture.

        Mohamed Salah is a slight doubt for Liverpool's match against Arsenal after
        picking up a knock in training. Manager Arne Slot said he's "75-80% likely"
        to feature, but there's definitely some rotation risk.

        Budget option Joao Pedro of Chelsea is in great form with 3 goals in his last
        2 games. At ¬£7.5m, he represents excellent value for money.

        Defensive picks: Gabriel of Arsenal continues to be a solid choice, averaging
        11 defensive actions per game plus clean sheet potential. Same with William
        Saliba who has been rock solid.

        Injury news ahead of the Gameweek 9 deadline:

        Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes is suspended after picking up his 5th
        yellow card. He will miss the next match.

        Alexander Isak is confirmed OUT for Newcastle with a hamstring injury.
        He's expected to miss 2-3 weeks.

        Kevin De Bruyne returned to training and is expected to start for Man City.
        This is positive news for City's attack.

        Bukayo Saka trained fully and is expected to start for Arsenal despite
        injury concerns earlier in the week.
