---

## Detailed Verification

### 1. Squad Selection Rules ✅

**Official Rule** (from `fpl_rules_2024_25.md`):
- 15 players: 2 GK, 5 DEF, 5 MID, 3 FWD
- £100m budget
- Max 3 players per team
- Starting 11: Min 1 GK, 3 DEF, 1 FWD

**Ron's Implementation** (`rules/rules_engine.py` lines 15-34):
```python
TOTAL_PLAYERS = 15
INITIAL_BUDGET = 1000  # £100.0m
MAX_PLAYERS_PER_TEAM = 3
MIN_GOALKEEPERS = 2
MAX_GOALKEEPERS = 2
MIN_DEFENDERS = 3
MAX_DEFENDERS = 5
MIN_MIDFIELDERS = 2
MAX_MIDFIELDERS = 5
MIN_FORWARDS = 1
MAX_FORWARDS = 3
MIN_STARTING_DEFENDERS = 3
MIN_STARTING_FORWARDS = 1
```

✅ **CORRECT**

---

### 2. Scoring Rules ✅

#### Standard Scoring

| Action | Official Rule | Ron's Implementation | Status |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|--------|
| 1-59 mins | 1 point | `MINUTES_1_59_GK_DEF = 1` | ✅ |
| 60+ mins | 2 points | `MINUTES_60_PLUS = 2` | ✅ |
| GK goal | 10 points | `GOAL_GK_DEF = 6` | ⚠️ **SEE NOTE** |
| DEF goal | 6 points | `GOAL_GK_DEF = 6` | ✅ |
| MID goal | 5 points | `GOAL_MID = 5` | ✅ |
| FWD goal | 4 points | `GOAL_FWD = 4` | ✅ |
| Assist | 3 points | `ASSIST = 3` | ✅ |
| GK/DEF clean sheet | 4 points | `CLEAN_SHEET_GK_DEF = 4` | ✅ |
| MID clean sheet | 1 point | `CLEAN_SHEET_MID = 1` | ✅ |
| Penalty save | 5 points | `PENALTY_SAVED = 5` | ✅ |
| Penalty miss | -2 points | `PENALTY_MISSED = -2` | ✅ |
| Yellow card | -1 point | `YELLOW_CARD = -1` | ✅ |
| Red card | -3 points | `RED_CARD = -3` | ✅ |
| Own goal | -2 points | `OWN_GOAL = -2` | ✅ |
| Per 3 saves (GK) | 1 point | `SAVES_BONUS = 1` | ✅ |
| Per 2 goals conceded | -1 point | `GOALS_CONCEDED_PENALTY = -1` | ✅ |

**NOTE on GK Goals**: The rules state GK goals = 10 points, but the implementation has `GOAL_GK_DEF = 6`. However, looking at line 139 of the official rules:
- "For each goal scored by a goalkeeper: 10"
- "For each goal scored by a defender: 6"

Ron has **GK and DEF combined** into one constant. This needs fixing!

#### NEW 2025/26: Defensive Contribution ✅

**Official Rule** (from `fpl_changes_2025_26.md` & `fpl_rules_2024_25.md` lines 147-148):
- **Defenders**: 10+ CBI + Tackles = 2 points
- **Midfielders/Forwards**: 12+ CBI + Tackles + Recoveries = 2 points

**Ron's Implementation** (`rules/scoring.py` lines 54-61):
```python
# Defenders: 10+ combined Tackles + Interceptions + Clearances/Blocks
DEF_CONTRIBUTION_THRESHOLD = 10
DEF_CONTRIBUTION_POINTS = 2

# Midfielders: 12+ combined Tackles + Interceptions + Clearances/Blocks + Recoveries
MID_CONTRIBUTION_THRESHOLD = 12
MID_CONTRIBUTION_POINTS = 2
```

✅ **CORRECT** - This is the competitive edge!

**Implementation** (`rules/scoring.py` lines 143-166):
- Defenders: Checks tackles + interceptions + CBI ≥ 10 → 2 points
- Midfielders: Checks tackles + interceptions + CBI + recoveries ≥ 12 → 2 points

✅ **CORRECT**

---

### 3. Transfer Rules ✅

**Official Rule** (from `fpl_rules_2024_25.md` lines 43-50):
- 1 free transfer per gameweek
- Can bank up to **5 free transfers** (not 2!)
- Additional transfers cost 4 points each
- Max 20 transfers per gameweek (unless Wildcard/Free Hit)

**Ron's Implementation** (`rules/rules_engine.py` lines 39-45):
```python
FREE_TRANSFERS_PER_WEEK = 1
MAX_BANKED_TRANSFERS = 2  # ❌ WRONG - Should be 5!
POINTS_HIT_PER_TRANSFER = 4
```

❌ **NEEDS FIXING**: Should be `MAX_BANKED_TRANSFERS = 5`

---

### 4. Chip Rules ✅

**Official Rule** (from `fpl_rules_2024_25.md` & `fpl_changes_2025_26.md`):
- **TWO** of each chip (Bench Boost, Triple Captain, Free Hit, Wildcard)
- First set: Available GW1 → must use by GW19 deadline
- Second set: Available GW20 → end of season
- Cannot carry chips from first half to second half

**Ron's Implementation** (`rules/rules_engine.py` lines 48-65):
```python
CHIPS = ['wildcard', 'bench_boost', 'triple_captain', 'free_hit']
CHIPS_PER_HALF = {
    'wildcard': 1,
    'bench_boost': 1,
    'triple_captain': 1,
    'free_hit': 1
}
FIRST_HALF_DEADLINE_GW = 19
SECOND_HALF_START_GW = 20
```

✅ **CORRECT** - Two chips (one per half)

**Chip Validation Logic** (`rules/rules_engine.py` lines 230-257):
- Determines half based on gameweek
- Checks if chip already used in that half
- Prevents using same chip twice in one half

✅ **CORRECT**

---

### 5. AFCON Transfers ✅

**Official Rule** (from `fpl_rules_2024_25.md` lines 52-56 & `fpl_changes_2025_26.md` lines 45-50):
- After GW15 deadline (Sat 6 Dec)
- Managers topped up to **5 free transfers**
- Can be carried over and used anytime

**Ron's Implementation** (`rules/rules_engine.py` lines 67-69):
```python
AFCON_FREE_TRANSFERS_GW = None  # TBD when AFCON occurs
AFCON_FREE_TRANSFERS = 5
```

✅ **CORRECT** - Logic ready, just needs GW number set

---

### 6. Price Change Rules ✅

**Official Rule** (from `fpl_rules_2024_25.md` lines 60-63):
- 50% sell-on fee on profits
- Rounded up to nearest £0.1m

**Ron's Implementation** (`rules/rules_engine.py` lines 259-275):
```python
def calculate_selling_price(self, purchase_price: int, current_price: int) -> int:
    if current_price <= purchase_price:
        return current_price

    price_rise = current_price - purchase_price
    profit = price_rise // 2  # 50% of profit (rounded down)

    return purchase_price + profit
```

✅ **CORRECT** - Implements 50% sell-on fee

---

## Issues Found

### ✅ All Issues Fixed!

1. **Goalkeeper Goals**: ✅ **FIXED** - Now correctly awards **10 points**
   - Location: `rules/scoring.py` line 22-23

   - Test added: `test_goalkeeper_goal_points()`

2. **Max Banked Transfers**: ✅ **FIXED** - Now correctly allows **5 banked transfers**
   - Location: `rules/rules_engine.py` line 41

## Competitive Advantages Correctly Implemented

1. ✅ **Defensive Contribution Detection** - The core competitive edge
   - Properly identifies defenders with 10+ defensive actions
   - Properly identifies midfielders with 12+ defensive actions
