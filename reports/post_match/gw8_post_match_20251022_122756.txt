RON'S POST-MATCH THOUGHTS - GAMEWEEK 8
======================================================================
*Lights cigar, pours a pint, settles into the chair*

66 points. Not bad at all. Beat the average by 13.
Can't complain with that. Solid gameweek.

======================================================================

MY LOT - THE BRUTALLY HONEST ASSESSMENT
======================================================================
✗ Captain Semenyo: 4 points
  Fucking hell. Semenyo was supposed to deliver. That's on me.

  • Haaland: 13 points - Delivered
  • Gabriel: 12 points - Delivered
  • Thiago: 8 points - Solid shift

VILLAINS:
  • Senesi: 2 points - Full 90, did nothing
  • Sarr: 2 points - Full 90, did nothing

Overall Rank: 12,066,058
Not where we want to be. Long season ahead.

THE VERDICT
======================================================================
Good weekend. The data worked, the picks delivered, job done.
This is what happens when you trust the fundamentals.

*Takes satisfied puff of cigar*

Right. That's enough analysis for one night.
Next gameweek is what matters now.
