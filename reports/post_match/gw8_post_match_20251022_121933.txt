RON'S POST-MATCH THOUGHTS - GAMEWEEK 8
======================================================================
*Lights cigar, pours a pint, settles into the chair*

46 points. Fuck sake.
7 below average. That's not good enough, is it?

======================================================================
THE PREMIER LEAGUE
======================================================================
• Crystal Palace 3-3 Bournemouth - Goals galore. Defenders punished.

======================================================================
MINI-LEAGUE SITUATION
======================================================================
League: League 160968
Position: 14 of 14

400 points off the pace. Bollocks.
This is embarrassing. Need some serious changes.

Big movers this week:
  ↓ Entry 1309029: -5 places (438 pts)
  ↑ Entry 6736693: +2 places (455 pts)

======================================================================
MY LOT - THE BRUTALLY HONEST ASSESSMENT
======================================================================
✗ Captain Semenyo: 4 points
  Fucking hell. Semenyo was supposed to deliver. That's on me.

HEROES:
  • Gabriel: 12 points - Delivered
  • Thiago: 8 points - Solid shift

VILLAINS:
  • Senesi: 2 points - Full 90, did nothing
  • Sarr: 2 points - Full 90, did nothing

======================================================================
Overall Rank: 12,066,058
Not where we want to be. Long season ahead.

======================================================================
THE VERDICT
======================================================================
Disappointing. No other word for it.
Need to have a hard look at the numbers and make some changes.
This is the game - you get it wrong, you pay for it.

*Drains pint in frustration*

Right. That's enough analysis for one night.
Next gameweek is what matters now.
