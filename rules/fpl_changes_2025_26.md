Fantasy Managers,

Welcome to the new season of Fantasy Premier League! We would like to share with you the new updates for the 2025/26 Premier League season

Defensive Contribution Points
This new method of points scoring will reward outfield players who may not stand out with a goal or an assist but still make significant contributions during a match. Bonus points do recognise these players but the tireless defensive work of defenders and midfielders can often lose out to the scorer of a vital goal.

Losing a clean sheet to a late strike can be painful for the FPL Manager and scant reward if a defender has been dominant throughout. Defensive Contribution seeks to resolve this and address the balance. It favours defenders who accumulate clearances, blocked shots, interceptions (CBI) and tackles rather than the attacking full-backs who are often the go-to options for our squads.

Any defender who reaches an accumulative total of 10 or more clearances, blocks, interceptions (CBI) and tackles in a single match will earn 2 points.

Midfielders and forwards can also earn these points. To recognise the role they play in regaining possession and turning defence into attack, their ball recoveries contribute to their Defensive Contribution.

A midfielder or forward who reaches an accumulative total of 12 or more clearances, blocks, interceptions (CBI) tackles and recoveries will earn 2 points.

As a result, centre-backs and defensive midfielders now play a more influential role in Fantasy squads.

Revised Assists
For the 2025/26 season, the definition of a Fantasy assist has been simplified to better recognise players for their contributions to goals, and to reduce the degree of subjectivity involved so that it is easier for managers to see when their player is getting an assist.

Players have not previously been awarded an assist if their pass or cross was deflected by an opponent away from the intended target or destination. Now this rule only applies to goals where the goalscorer receives the ball outside of the penalty area.

For the majority of goals, the ball is received by the goalscorer inside the penalty box and more of these will now be rewarded with assists.

The intended target or destination of a pass will no longer be a factor and a Fantasy assist will be awarded when the goalscorer receives the ball inside the penalty box and there is only one defensive touch before the ball reaches them, as long as that touch from an opposing player is not a pass.

If the goalscorer receives the ball outside the box, the old rules remain - a judgment will be made about whether they were the intended target of the pass. That judgment is often a far easier and clearer one to make when the ball is received outside a busy penalty box.

If these rules had been in place for the 24/25 season, there would have been 41 additional Fantasy assists awarded.

Additional Chips
All the chips now replicate the Wildcard and are available for both the first and second part of the season. Like the Wildcard, no chip can be carried over and must be used before the specified Gameweek deadline.

The first Bench Boost and Triple Captain chips will be available from the start of the season until the Gameweek 19 deadline of Tue 30 Dec 18:30. The second set of these chips will be available for Gameweek 20 and can be used up until the end of the season. Both of these chips can be cancelled before the Gameweek deadline.

There will also be two Free Hit and Wildcard chips available during the season. The first of these chips will be available from the start of the season and must be played by the Gameweek 19 deadline of Tue 30 Dec 18:30. The second set of these chips will be available for Gameweek 20 and can be used up until the end of the season. These chips are played when confirming transfers and they cannot be cancelled once confirmed.

Bonus Points System Changes
The Bonus Points System (BPS) has been changed to better recognise defenders and goalkeepers, boosting their likelihood of gaining bonus points.

Goalkeepers still earn 2 BPS for a save but if the save is from a shot made from inside the box, they now earn an additional 1 BPS.
A goal-line clearance is now worth 9 BPS (formerly 3 BPS).
Successful Tackles earn 2 BPS (formerly 2 BPS for every Successful Tackles minus Lost Tackles).
All goals scored directly from a penalty score 12 BPS regardless of the position of the goalscorer (formerly 12 for defenders, 18 for midfielders and 24 for forwards).
African Cup of Nations (AFCON) Transfers
With AFCON taking place from December 21 to January 18 this season, Managers will be given additional transfers to allow them to deal with player absence during this period.

Following the Gameweek 15 Deadline on Sat 6 Dec 13:30 and ahead of Gameweek 16 on Sat 13 Dec 13:30, Managers will be topped up to the maximum of 5 free transfers, regardless of how many transfers are available to them at that point.

These Free Transfers do not need to be used in Gameweek 16, they can be carried over between Gameweeks and used at any time.

Club Badge Creator with Adobe Express
New for the 25/26 Fantasy season, you can create a club badge using Adobe Express and its Firefly generative AI tool.

Upon entering your FPL team, youâ€™ll be prompted with the option to generate your custom team badge. You can start creating your badge immediately or return to it later.

If you choose to create your badge, Adobe Express will open, and you will be asked to begin by entering a prompt for the Firefly AI to use when generating images. You will then be asked to log in or create an Adobe account to view your images and continue.

New Classic Leagues
There are additional Global Leagues added for the 25/26 season that have some qualifying criteria based on your previous rank.

The 1% League is made up of managers from the top 1% of ranks from the 24/25 season. Similarly, the 10% League consists of managers from the top 10% of ranks from the 24/25 season.

Good luck for the the season,

FPL Team
